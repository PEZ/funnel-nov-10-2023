# Demo: Interactive Programming is a mindset

* It can be easy <-> fully interactive
  * Small Talk, Clojure can get there
    * Joyride is almost there
* We can work more interactive though
* An example for JS

* `hello Hello ${s}!~;`
* `hello =`, we lack s-expressions
* `const s=` 
* redeclare const
* promises work
* importing node modules
* not top level await, work-around
* updating imported files
* namespacing is lacking

I intend to try create a Clojure level experience.
