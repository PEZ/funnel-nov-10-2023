# Demo: Interactive Programming

* Very simple app, a counter and also a wizard
* Clojure server + client app, both have REPL servers
* Change button color, render, shadow, notice state
* Inspect state on the client, app-db, wizard, subscription, dispatch on the counter
* Inspect state on the server, modify state, inspect request, modify behaviour
* the request is an open map
* Modify behaviour on the client, fizzbuzz
* Create branch fizzbuzz
* (mod n m) â€¦ defn fizz, installera fizz
* multiple-of?, map partial, 3 5 15, tables (range 1 19)
* defn fizz med multiple-of?
* defn fizz-buzz med if, sedan cond, installera fizz-buzz

* The file is not saved.
* Playing it safe. Gains much bigger with real programming.

* My YouTube channel CalvaTV, FizzBuzz
