# How is Clojure special?

* Pragmatic, you are not a jail
* Has changed my TypeScript
* Brackets, comma is whitespace
* 20% compared to Java not uncommon
* Just use maps! EDN
* Little boilerplate, small code bases
* Culture shift macros -> data, homoiconicity
* Abstractions, immutable, sequence, first class functions
* JVM and NPM ecosystems, interop strength
* Not Rich Hickey’s experimental platform
* Focused on business problems
  * Minimize accidental complexity
* Easy to create DSLs (but often you don’t need to)
* Attracts experienced developers, tops SO charts for highest payed
* Pragmatic, sometime interop instead of core
  * CLJS changed this a bit
