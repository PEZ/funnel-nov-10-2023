# Calva

* Getting started repl, Java and Calva needed
  * `hello_repl.clj`
  * I skip paredit.clj (you shouldn’t)
  * `welcome_to_clojure.clj`
  * the basics of Clojure
  * since we know how to use the repl …
  * I hope you try this yourself and give me feedback.

* We’ll skip learning Clojure here and now.
  * I was Interactive Programming.
    * app running
    * querying and modifying,
    * not a very obvious.
    * another app.
    * Two apps.
